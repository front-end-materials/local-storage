# JavaScript Local Storage

An example of three increasingly detailed data objects stored in `localStorage()`.

Since local storage only accepts string, the following JSON functions are used:

- `JSON.stringify()` turns a data object into a string
- `JSON.parse()` turns a string back into a JavaScript data object

Also, `map` is used to iterate through the key-value pairs in the data objects - see the links in get.js and set.js.

**Note:** this example needs to run on a server (VSCode has a "Go Live" button, bottom right) or view on GitHub pages.
