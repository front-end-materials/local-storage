# A simple introduction to JavaScript and Local Storage

You can [view this page here](https://front-end-materials.github.io/local-storage/local-storage-form/).

This demo uses JavaScript and localstorage to retain some data between sessions, so the data remains stored in the browser after users close the browser window.

## Security warning in the error console

For this to work as expected you need to *run the file on a server* (e.g.GitHub pages) or from a *local server* (e.g. with Node installed [`node http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)).
