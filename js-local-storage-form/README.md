# A simple introduction to JavaScript and Local Storage

You can [view this page here](https://ctec3905.github.io/js-local-storage-form/).

This exercise uses JavaScript and localstorage to retain some data between sessions, so the data remains stored in the browser after users close the browser window.

## Security warning in the error console

Apple's [Safari browser will display a security warning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8x5keq/javascript_localstorage_not_working_on_safari/), but if you run the file on GitHub pages or from a local server (e.g. [node http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) it will work as expected.
